Chiller:
  definition: "Refrigerating machine used to transfer heat between fluids. Chillers are either direct expansion with a compressor or absorption type."

  haystack-class: chiller-equip

Cooling Tower:
  definition: "A cooling tower is a heat rejection device that rejects waste heat to the atmosphere through the cooling of a water stream to a lower temperature. Cooling towers may either use the evaporation of water to remove process heat and cool the working fluid to near the wet-bulb air temperature or, in the case of closed circuit dry cooling towers, rely solely on air to cool the working fluid to near the dry-bulb air temperature."
